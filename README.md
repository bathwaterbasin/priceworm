# üêõ PRICEWORM

A trading analysis tool that tracks key market timing patterns and crypto sentiment metrics across four "sacred times" during the trading day.

## Overview

Priceworm is a market observation tool that focuses on temporal patterns and sentiment indicators across cryptocurrency and traditional futures markets. The system monitors specific times of day when liquidity shifts and market structure changes occur, providing traders with contextual data for decision-making.

## Features

### Sacred Times Monitor (Wormholes)

Four key times throughout the trading day when market structure transitions occur:

- **00:43 EDT** - Midnight: Overnight positioning and Asian market influence
- **05:43 EDT** - Premarket: European open and early US futures activity
- **12:43 EDT** - Midday: Peak US market liquidity
- **17:43 EDT** - Afterhours: Regular trading session close and futures roll

The tool automatically converts these times to your local timezone and provides countdown timers to the next observation window.

### Trading Methodology: Sacred Wormhole Limit Orders

**Critical Trading Rule:** All trades are placed using **limit orders only** at the exact price level recorded at each of the four sacred wormholes.

**The Process:**
1. Record the price at each sacred time (00:43, 05:43, 12:43, 17:43 EDT)
2. Set limit orders at these exact prices
3. Price often retests these levels during the following session
4. Orders fill when price returns to the wormhole level

These wormhole prices act as intraday support/resistance levels. Market participants frequently revisit these prices as they represent key liquidity transition points. By placing limit orders at wormhole prices, traders position themselves at institutional reference levels rather than chasing momentum.

### Cryptocurrency Metrics Lookup

The crypto metrics tool tracks sentiment and positioning indicators:

- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)** - Institutional reference price levels
- **Coinbase Premium** - The spread between Coinbase and other exchanges, indicating US institutional buying/selling pressure
- **Futures-to-Spot Bias** - The differential between futures contracts and spot prices, revealing leverage positioning and funding rate dynamics
- **Sacred Time Correlations** - Price action patterns around the four key times

### SPX 500 Futures Gap Analysis

S&P 500 futures gap tracking provides context for broader market sentiment:

- **Weekday Gap** - The price gap that forms daily between 17:00-18:00 EDT when regular trading closes but futures continue
- **Weekend Gap** - The larger gap from Friday 17:00 EDT through Sunday 18:00 EDT
- **Gap Direction & Magnitude** - Critical sentiment indicator for crypto confluence trading

These gaps represent periods when equity index futures trade without the spot market, creating price discovery inefficiencies that often correlate with crypto market sentiment shifts.

## Trading Methodology: Confluence Approach

The Priceworm approach uses confluence between crypto-specific metrics and traditional market gap analysis:

1. **Identify SPX futures gap direction** - Determines broader risk sentiment
2. **Check crypto metrics at sacred times** - VWAP position, Coinbase premium, futures bias
3. **Look for confluence** - When multiple indicators align (e.g., negative SPX gap + negative Coinbase premium + backwardated futures)
4. **Set limit orders at wormhole prices** - Place orders at the exact price from each sacred time
5. **Wait for retest** - Price often returns to these levels during subsequent sessions

The sacred times represent liquidity transition points where these metrics show clearest signals, and the prices at these times become tradeable levels.

## Technical Details

### Timezone Conversion

Sacred times are defined in EDT (UTC-4) and automatically converted to the user's local timezone using JavaScript Date objects. The conversion accounts for:

- Local UTC offset
- Daylight saving time differences
- Next-day rollover when times have passed

### Metrics Calculation

**Coinbase Premium:**
```
Premium = (Coinbase Price - Binance Price) / Binance Price √ó 100
```

**Futures Basis:**
```
Basis = (Futures Price - Spot Price) / Spot Price √ó 100
```

Positive basis = Contango (futures higher, bullish leverage)  
Negative basis = Backwardation (futures lower, bearish leverage)

## Data Sources

Users should connect their own data sources for:
- Real-time crypto prices (Coinbase, Binance APIs)
- SPX futures quotes (CME data feeds)
- VWAP calculations (volume-weighted from OHLCV data)
